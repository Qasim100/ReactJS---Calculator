# MINI CALCULATOR using ReactJS

This is a practice project, in which, i tried to have good understanding of states(usestate(),setstate()) and CSS properties.
This calculator takes input from MOUSE ONLY and it is just a simple calculator(not scientific). I will try to add keyboard input functionality later.

Packages used: 

1- Bootstrap-icons

use "npm start" for starting the project.
